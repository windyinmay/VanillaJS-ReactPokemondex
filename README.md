# PokémonDex

A simple Pokédex web application built with **React**.  
This project started as a **mock Front-End interview assignment** that I forked on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/i7clq). It became a fun way for me to relearn **data fetching in React** and practice state management, hooks, and styling.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎲 Display a **random Pokémon** on load
